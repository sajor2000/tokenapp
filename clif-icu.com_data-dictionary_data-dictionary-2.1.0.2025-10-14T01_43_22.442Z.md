Future Proposed Tables

## CLIF Data Dictionary

The CLIF Data Dictionary serves as a comprehensive guide to the Common Longitudinal ICU data Format, detailing the structure and purpose of each table within the framework. Designed to standardize and harmonize electronic health record data across multiple institutions, the dictionary outlines the entity-relationship model, variable definitions, and permissible values.

![ERD](https://clif-icu.com/images/data-dictionary/ERD-2.1.0-09052025.png)

## Beta Tables

The table purpose, structure, and field names for beta tables is complete and used in at least one federated CLIF project. The minimum Common ICU Data Elements (mCIDE) for category variables is defined. Actively testing the table‚Äôs practical use in projects. Breaking changes unlikely, but backward compatible updates in future minor versions possible

## adt Beta

The admission, discharge, and transfer (adt) table is a start-stop longitudinal dataset that contains information about each patient‚Äôs movement within the hospital. It also has a _`hospital_id`_ field to distinguish between different hospitals within a health system.

![Unstable](https://clif-icu.com/images/icons/unstable.png)

| Column | Type | Description | Permissible Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hospitalization\_id | VARCHAR | ID variable for each patient encounter | No restriction |
| hospital\_id | VARCHAR | Assign a unique ID to each hospital within a healthsystem | No restriction |
| hospital\_type | VARCHAR | Maps _`hospital_id`_ to a standardized list of hospital types | [academic, community, LTACH](https://github.com/Common-Longitudinal-ICU-data-Format/CLIF/blob/main/mCIDE/adt/clif_adt_hospital_type.csv) |
| in\_dttm | DATETIME | Start date and time at a particular location. All datetime variables must be timezone-aware and set to UTC. | Datetime format should be YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+00:00 (UTC) |
| out\_dttm | DATETIME | End date and time at a particular location. All datetime variables must be timezone-aware and set to UTC. | Datetime format should be YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+00:00 (UTC) |

**Notes**:

- ADT represents the patient‚Äôs physical location, NOT the patient ‚Äústatus‚Äù.
- Procedural areas and operating rooms should be mapped to `Procedural`. Pre/Intra/Post-procedural/OR EHR data (such as anesthesia flowsheet records from Labs, Vitals, Scores, Respiratory Support) **are not currently** represented in CLIF.

## hospital diagnosis Beta

Finalized billing diagnosis codes for hospital reimbursement, e.g. calculation of a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG). These diagnoses also do not have timestamps, as they are often finalized after discharge. The `hospital_diagnosis` table is appropriate for calculation of comorbidity scores but should not be used as input features into a prediction model for an inpatient event.

All other diagnosis codes for a patient are included under concept table `patient_diagnosis` which has start and end timestamps.

![Unstable](https://clif-icu.com/images/icons/unstable.png)

## hospitalization Beta

The hospitalization table contains information about each hospitalization event. Each row in this table represents a unique hospitalization event for a patient. This table is inspired by the [visit\_occurance](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#visit_occurrence) OMOP table but is specific to inpatient hospitalizations (including those that begin in the emergency room).

![Unstable](https://clif-icu.com/images/icons/unstable.png)

| census\_block\_group\_code | VARCHAR | [12 digit FIPS code](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html) | No restriction |
| census\_tract | VARCHAR | [Full 11 digit FIPS code](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html). Eg. 13089022404 `census_tract` is the state (13) + the county (089) + the census tract (022404). | No restriction |
| state\_code | VARCHAR | [2 digit FIPS code](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html) | No restriction |
| county\_code | VARCHAR | [Full 5 digit FIPS code](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html). Eg. 13089 `county_code` is the state (13) + the county (089). | No restriction |

**Notes**:

- If a patient is discharged to Home/Hospice, then `discharge_category == Hospice`.
- The geographical indicators ( `zipcode_nine_digit`, `zipcode_five_digit`, `census_block_code`, `census_block_group_code`, `census_tract`, `state_code`, `county_code`) should be added if they are available in your source dataset. `zipcode_nine_digit` is preferred over `zipcode_five_digit`, and `census_block_code` is ideal for census based indicators. The choice of geographical indicators may differ depending on the project.
- If a patient is transferred between different hospitals within a health system, a new `hospitalization_id` should be created.
- If a patient is initially seen in an ER in hospital A and then admitted to inpatient status in hospital B, one `hospitalization_id` should be created for data from both stays.
- A `hospitalization_joined_id` can also be created from a CLIF table from contiguous `hospitalization_ids`.
- **Geo-based Indices (ADI, SVI):**
  - _ADI_: Calculate the Area Deprivation Index at the census **block-group** level. Provide `census_block_group_code` when possible, or `zipcode_nine_digit` (9-digit ZIP) that can be cross-walked to a block group. Avoid using 5-digit ZIP or census-tract values for ADI‚Äîthey are not validated and will add error.
  - _SVI_: The Social Vulnerability Index is published at `census_tract` (full 11-digit FIPS).

**Example**:

| patient\_id | hospitalization\_id | hospitalization\_joined\_id | admission\_dttm | discharge\_dttm | age\_at\_admission | admission\_type\_name | admission\_type\_category | discharge\_name | discharge\_category | zipcode\_five\_digit | zipcode\_nine\_digit | census\_block\_group\_code | latitude | longitude | fips\_version |

## medication admin continuous Beta

This table captures medications administered at a rate over time, with NO set dose to be given. Examples include vasopressors, sedation, and paralysis drips. Multiple observations capture how the medication rate varies over time.

The medication admin continuous table is a long-form (one medication administration record per) longitudinal table designed for continuous infusions of common ICU medications such as vasopressors and sedation (Boluses of these drugs should be recorded in `med_admin_intermittent`). Note that it only reflects dose changes of the continuous medication and does not have a specific ‚Äúend\_time‚Äù variable to indicate the medication being stopped. The end of a continuous infusion should be recorded as a new row with med\_dose = 0 and an appropriate mar\_action\_name (e.g. ‚Äústopped‚Äù or ‚Äúpaused‚Äù).

## medication admin intermittent Beta

This table captures medications administered as fixed doses at discrete time points. Examples include antibiotics, steroids, and other medications given as boluses or scheduled doses. Each row represents ONE observation for each medication administered.

This table has exactly the same schema as [`medication_admin_continuous`](https://clif-icu.com/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-2.1.0#medication-admin-continuous). The consortium decided to separate the medications that are administered intermittently from the continuously administered medications. The mCIDE for `medication_category` for intermittent meds can be found [here](https://github.com/Common-Longitudinal-ICU-data-Format/CLIF/blob/main/mCIDE/medication_admin_intermittent/clif_medication_admin_intermittent_med_categories.csv).
